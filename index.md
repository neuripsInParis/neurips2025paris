NeurIPS@Paris 2025 is a 2-day event that takes place at Sorbonne Université on the 25<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> of November. This event provides a local alternative to the <a href="https://nips.cc/">NeurIPS conference</a>. It aims to address some sustainability and inclusivity concerns in machine learning research. All students and researchers are welcome to attend.

Authors of all accepted papers at NeurIPS 2024 are allowed to present their work through an oral presentation and/or a poster session. We unfortunately cannot accommodate oral presentations for all accepted papers; a subset of accepted papers will be proposed for an oral presentation, based on scientific quality, thematic coherence, and diversity criteria.

## Registration

The event is free, but registration is mandatory. Registration will be open shortly after the official NeurIPS decision.

This event is in-person only: we will neither record presentations nor include online options.

## Venue

This event will take place at Campus Jussieu (4 Place Jussieu, Paris 5ème).

To access by metro, go to Jussieu station on line 10.

The presentations will be held in amphithéâtre 25. All social events (poster sessions, mentor and career sessions, cocktail and lunch) will be held in SCAI and in the Esclangon building, which is located within Jussieu. A map of Jussieu is available <a href="docs/assets/plan_neurips2022v2.jpg"> here</a>.

## Sustainability ambitions

We aim to organize a local and sustainable alternative to in-person attendance to international ML conferences. To this aim:

- We strongly encourage participants to NeurIPS@Paris to travel to Paris by sustainable means.
<!-- - We offer fully vegeterian catering. -->
- We encourage participants to consider as much as possible not flying to the main NeurIPS conference.
