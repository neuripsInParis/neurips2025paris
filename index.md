NeurIPS@Paris 2025 is a 2-day event that takes place at Sorbonne Université on the 25<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> of November 2025. This event provides a local alternative to the <a href="https://nips.cc/">NeurIPS conference</a>. It aims to address some sustainability and inclusivity concerns in machine learning research. All students and researchers are welcome to attend.

Authors of all accepted papers at NeurIPS 2025 are allowed to present their work through an oral presentation and/or a poster session. We unfortunately cannot accommodate oral presentations for all accepted papers; a subset of accepted papers will be proposed for an oral presentation, based on scientific quality, thematic coherence, and diversity criteria.

## Registration
The event is free, but registration is mandatory. Registration are now closed. 

This event is in-person only: we will neither record presentations nor include online options.

## Venue
This event will take place at Campus Jussieu (4 Place Jussieu, Paris 5ème).

To access by metro, go to Jussieu station on line 10.

The presentations will be held in amphithéâtre 25. All social events (poster sessions, mentor and career sessions, cocktail and lunch) will be held in SCAI and in the Esclangon building, which is located within Jussieu. A map of Jussieu is available <a href="docs/assets/plan_neurips2022v2.jpg"> here</a>.

## Schedule 

The event is planned to start at 8:45am on November 25 and to end at 6:30pm on November 26.

It will feature oral presentations and poster sessions of NeurIPS 2025, as well as two opening keynotes on the 25th and 26th November (details below).

The schedule is available <a href="docs/assets/Schedule_2025.pdf"> here</a>. Two poster sessions are planned, the detailed planning will be available soon.

### Opening keynotes
This year, we have the honour to host [Anne-Laure Ligozat]() and [Gaël Varoquaux](https://gael-varoquaux.info/) for the opening keynotes on the 25th November and 26th November, respectively.

Details will be announced soon.

### Scientific presentations
The presentations are divided into 6 thematic sessions, details will be announced soon. Each presentation will last 12 minutes. In the interest of time, questions should be deferred to the poster session. Speakers will also be able to present their work in the corresponding poster session.

## Mentoring
Participants to NeurIPS in Paris will have the possibility to participate in a mentoring session with senior researchers from academia and industry. The mentoring session will take place at Sorbonne University\'e from 5:30pm to 6:30pm on the 26th November. Details will be announced soon.

## Sustainability ambitions

We aim to organize a local and sustainable alternative to in-person attendance to international ML conferences. To this aim:

- We strongly encourage participants to NeurIPS@Paris to travel to Paris by sustainable means.
<!-- - We offer fully vegeterian catering. -->
- We encourage participants to consider as much as possible not flying to the main NeurIPS conference.

## EurIPS
Extending the spirit of local and sustainable events, [EurIPS](https://eurips.cc/) proposes an officially endorsed event in Copenhagen between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> December 2025, on the same period as the official conference and one week after NeurIPS@Paris. We encourage participants to consider, as much as possible, this ecological alternative.
